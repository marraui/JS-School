When British math whiz Emmie Trowbridge finds herself teaching at an island school amid the Pacific Ocean, she doesn't expect to meet Roger Malcolm, the American designer of a nuclear bomb detection system. But it's love at first sight for the pair, and they go on to help save the world from sure disaster. This story is a prequel to Flight from Hanoi - Into the Terror of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, a Roger Malcolm novel based on the author's real-life interactions with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. About the Author Richard S. Greeley is a retired nuclear expert who seeks solutions to global warming as a specialist in the environmental and green energy fields. As an employee of a nonprofit research and development firm, he developed a nuclear bomb detection system and, in 1962, successfully tested it on a Pacific Ocean island where the U.S. Air Force was detonating thermonuclear weapons. He also assisted the air force during the Cuban Missile Crisis. A veteran of the U.S. Naval Reserve, he holds a bachelor's degree from Harvard University, a master's degree from Northwestern University and he has a Ph.D. in chemistry, with a minor in nuclear engineering from the University of Tennesse. A Boston native, he lives in St. Davids, Pennsylvania.",

Though Max knew that despite his wealth he was a far cry from Prince Charming, he still wondered what would happen if he stole a kiss to wake this sleeping beauty. Sheltered by her overprotective parents, shy Sarah Jennings yearned to be the kind of woman who could attract a cosmopolitan man like Max. But her innocence hadn't scared Max away - in fact, the gruff loner seemed to delight in showing her how to live life on her own terms. Soon Sarah had one more desire she just had to fulfill - if only she could persuade Max to agree!",
